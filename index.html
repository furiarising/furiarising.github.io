    <p class="welcome">Welcome to Furia Rising!</p>


    <p class="intro">
        Furia Rising is a unique game that has been created by lifelong gamer friends, and a great artist. 
        We want everyone to have a great, fun offline game that is free-to-play. We were able to amass a great playtesting group of about 100 people, and are constantly fixing and updating the game.
        We have some far fetched ideas and plans that will change the gaming world, if we are able to dedicate more time and build a bigger team. 
        
        
        We promise to reinvest the money back into the game as much as possible and we will never forget or stop listening to our players/fans. 
        This is a unique case of a highly ethical and talented development team with an extremely deep insight into all games, 
        from PC, to older mmorpgs, and other strategy games, and we have a creative vision that we ultimately want people to see. 

        This is not a corporate game with too many 'cooks in the kitchen', but a game that has a ton of content, strategy opportunities, and 
        a great community.

        As of today, we have 7 different skills, you can receieve up to 18 'Risers' that mine for ore. Each time you level, you can spend 4 skill points.
        With the ores, you can make ingots, and then craft equipment to attach to the Risers. Eventually, the Risers start doing a lot of damage and will mine very fast. 
        While mining, you will find drops, such as 'Relics'. These give you an active ability and a buff that increases progress on the Kingdom. Also, crafting of equipment,
        you may sometimes get a high stat equipment, and sometimes an average equipment. While you are sleeping, your kingdom is still making progress and will give you money and experience when you relog in!
        
        
        We also have a great referral system, so if you want to support us, please refer your friends we would greatly appreciate that.
